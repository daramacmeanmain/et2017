# Emerging Technologies Project 2017
## Overview
This is my solution for the Emerging Technologies project, which is a web application that recognises handwritten digits in images. It allows the user to upload an image of a digit and let the system see if it can determine what digit that is. The system then outputs it as text.

## Instructions
This application was written using the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) library in [Python 3](https://www.python.org) and both must be installed in order to run it.

Once they're both installed, the application can run locally by cloning this repository and opening it in the command line.

Once in the correct directory, the application can be run using:
```
$ python webapp.py
```

And finally, it can be accessed from a webrowser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
